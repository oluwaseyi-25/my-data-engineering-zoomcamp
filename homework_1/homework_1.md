# Module 1 Homework: Docker & SQL

In this homework we'll prepare the environment and practice
Docker and SQL

When submitting your homework, you will also need to include
a link to your GitHub repository or other public code-hosting
site.

This repository should contain the code for solving the homework.

When your solution has SQL or shell commands and not code
(e.g. python files) file format, include them directly in
the README file of your repository.

## Learning in Public

We encourage everyone to share what they learned. This is called "learning in public".

### Why learn in public?

- Accountability: Sharing your progress creates commitment and motivation to continue
- Feedback: The community can provide valuable suggestions and corrections
- Networking: You'll connect with like-minded people and potential collaborators
- Documentation: Your posts become a learning journal you can reference later
- Opportunities: Employers and clients often discover talent through public learning

Don't worry about being perfect. Everyone starts somewhere, and people love following genuine learning journeys!
